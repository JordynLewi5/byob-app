# Social Media Insights Engine

The project I selected was the Social Media Insights Engine. It consists of a search bar for searching for profile by both `name` and `username`. 

The first filter is a keyword search for profile bios.

Located directly below that is a set of sliding range filters for the following attributes:
`followers`
`average views`
`average likes`
`average comments`
`average shares`
`average saves`

Then the list of users will be generated below in a scrollable block.

Each user can be clicked on to pull up their profile. In the profile screen, you will find basic information about the user as well as a generated list of their posts with links to each post.

# File Structure
The structure of the project can be broken down into 4 main sections:
`public` - contains any images, data, etc. and the root index.html file
`src` - contains the actual code, specifically the App.js and index.js files for establishing the root components, as well as the following directories:
`js` - contains the JavaScript code for rendering and performing any operations for the app.
`styles` - contains the CSS files that style the app.

# Below is a guide to get the code running on your local machine.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
